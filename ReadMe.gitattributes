1. How to generate an optimal timetable
menu -> compute -> computer button
show optimal -> show final optimal timetable

2. View structure
right view -> branch-and-bound tree, where the white line means the node is dominated.
left view -> timetable

3. View timetable at each node
toolbar -> T button -> train list

If there is a "x" sign before node number, it means the node is dominated.
